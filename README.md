# Student Bio Page

## Description

For this application I was motivated to create a webpage which could act as a mini portfolio, where I could add links to social media, an image of myself and some text explaining what I do. 

During the process I learnt how css selectors work, when targeting specific html elements or classes/ID attributes. 

## Installation

As this was a feature request challenge I was provided with the starter code which provided me access to the html/css files.

Once I received this I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync. 

Afterwards, I used vscode which is an integrated development environment which allowed me to update the software code.

Lastly, once I was done I pushed all the updates to my remote repository from my local repo using commits, and once I was happy I deployed the changes to the live website.
